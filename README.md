# OCS_Internship

The Repository has all the details about my Journey of the OCS Internship Drive.


# Intern Prep
The initial preparation phase mainly involved balancing Competitive Programming (CP) with my coursework. As a CS student, my academics were demanding, so they remained my priority. I worked on CP whenever I had free time, maintaining this pattern through my 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th semesters. The real preparation began in the latter half of the 4th semester.

During this period, I focused on maintaining good grades, achieving an SGPA of 9.41, which was decent. This momentum carried into the summer vacation. Once the semester ended, my hostel friends and I sought guidance from successful seniors, who were incredibly helpful.

The most crucial advice from seniors, which I also emphasize, is the importance of being part of an "active prep community." Form a circle of 3-4 friends, stay connected throughout the preparation season, and progress together. This is essential.

At this point, I was a Specialist on Codeforces with a rating of around 1500. Seniors advised that to secure a Quant internship (a highly sought-after role), a minimum rating of 1600 was recommended. With a CGPA of 9.3, my academic standing was solid.

My friends and I, highly motivated, formed a WhatsApp group called "QD" (Quant Discussion) and committed to keeping it active throughout the vacation.

After dispersing from college to our hometowns, I dedicated the first two weeks entirely to CP, pushing myself as much as possible. Although my rating didn’t increase, I was content with the effort. Initially, we all had similar ratings around 1500.

A couple of my friends reached the Expert level during this time, which was encouraging. After two weeks of CP, I decided to start preparing for Quant roles. This involved solving standard brain teasers, puzzles, probability, and statistics problems.

Seniors recommended three books: "Xinfeng Zhou," "50 Challenging Problems," and "Heard on The Street." I split my day into two halves—one for Quant prep and the other for CP. This routine continued for two weeks, after which I completed one book, but my rating remained the same.

Realizing the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I added NeetCode 150 to my schedule. This routine took up most of my time.

In the later phase, I spent two weeks reading OOPS articles on GeeksforGeeks and preparing my CV.

## Summary of My Preparation Journey
Completed all three recommended books, "PuzzledQuant," and "Brain Teasers."
Gave significant effort to CP, though my rating remained around 1500.
Solved around 200 problems on NeetCode.
Reviewed Computer Architecture (memory-related topics) and Probability distributions.
Managed an online research internship alongside, as part of a team project.
Despite not being overly confident in securing a Quant role, I felt my decent CGPA and coding abilities ensured a good shot at software roles. I returned to college 10 days before the official date to acclimate to the atmosphere, anticipating the intense period ahead.


# The Online Assessments (OAs)

The real challenge began around July 15, when OAs started rolling in. Initially, we faced two assessments per day, which increased to five or six by July 19-20.

My early OAs didn’t go as well as I’d hoped, but I focused on being patient. This mindset is crucial—believe in your abilities, stay patient, and remember that you only need one successful shot to secure a good internship.

As more friends returned to the hostel, it felt like we were all in the same boat, which normalized the experience. Gradually, my OA performances improved.

Some of the companies I took OAs for included:

DE Shaw, Salesforce, Eightfold AI, Ebullient Securities, Alphagrep, Google, Microsoft, APT, KLA, Skan AI, Millennium QR, Millennium Dev, and others.

Once the semester officially started, the process became even more intense, with OAs running from 4:00 PM to 1:00 AM in the Lecture Hall. We worked in groups, bringing extension boards, finding charger plugs, and securing seats together.

Additional companies with offline OAs included:

Optiver, Tower, WorldQuant, Da Vinci, NK Securities, Citadel, Qube Research, Samsung Korea, Atlas Research, Adobe, Oracle, Graviton, Quadeye (HK), Goldman Sachs, JPMC, Texas Instruments, and more.

Shortlists for interviews began coming in around August 1. I was shortlisted for eight companies and waitlisted for two.

# Day 1


Day 1 was divided into two slots. If you get selected in the first, you don't proceed to the second.

## My Slot 1 Preferences
Citadel (SWE)
WorldQuant
Glean
Goldman Sachs
## My Slot 2 Preferences
Qube
Ebullient Securities
Eightfold AI
## The Dilemma
Before the day began, I faced a dilemma—whether to intentionally skip the Goldman Sachs interview or not. The options in Slot 2 seemed more appealing to me. I consulted with several seniors, and they advised me to consider skipping it but also to keep safety in mind. It was a tough decision to make right before Day 1.

## The Start of the Day
My first interview was scheduled for 6 AM—quite early! The night before, I did some mock interview practice with my friends, which helped to some extent, but excitement made it difficult for me to sleep. I remember tossing and turning the entire night. Eventually, I managed to get some rest and woke up at 4:30 AM.

When I checked the schedule, I was relieved to see that my interviews were slotted in the order of my preferences.

## Citadel Interview
The first interview was with Citadel, a basic live coding question that took place from 6:30 to 7:00 AM. It went well enough, but I knew the day had just begun.

## WorldQuant Interview
Next was the WorldQuant interview. They asked me to explain my internship and presented me with three challenging puzzles. I used hints to arrive at the answers, but I made sure my explanations were solid.

## Glean Interview
At 8:00 AM, I had my Glean interview, which consisted of two continuous rounds of basic DSA live coding questions, followed by an HR round. I found the HR round particularly enjoyable and felt confident about my performance.

## Second Round of WorldQuant
Despite feeling good about the Glean interview, I wasn't entirely confident about Citadel and WorldQuant. I got a call for the second round of WorldQuant, so I decided to skip the crowded GS interview for now and focus on WorldQuant. In this second round, they asked me another tricky puzzle, but I struggled with it. They also asked some questions related to my CV.

## Third Round of WorldQuant
For the third round of WorldQuant, the focus shifted to Machine Learning, Statistics, and related topics—no puzzles this time. The interview was intense, but I handled it well.

## Citadel's Second Round
By 11:30 AM, I was running on adrenaline, having been up since 4:30 AM without even a bite to eat. But everyone was in the same boat, so I powered through. The second round of Citadel went fine, though not exceptionally well.

## Goldman Sachs Interview
At this point, I had to decide about Goldman Sachs. After some careful thought, I followed my instinct and went for it. The interview consisted of one probability round followed by an easy HR round.

## The HR Call from WorldQuant
Around 12:30 PM, I got a call from WorldQuant for an HR discussion. We walked through the corridor as the HR asked me about my motivation, career plans, CGPA, DR, and preferences. It was a casual but crucial conversation.



Later, I found out that I was among nine candidates, and WorldQuant had to select four from us. It was reassuring to know I was in the running.


# The Result

Intense discussions followed in the HR room. Meanwhile, we tried eavesdropping but couldn’t decode their conversation. Eventually, I checked the portal and found an offer from WorldQuant! I was waiting on Citadel, but the offer didn’t come through.

Still, I was thrilled with the WorldQuant offer and am looking forward to the internship next summer.
